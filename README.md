# Task-Five

Task is the classic Trello card with an optional image, a title and a set of icons

List is composed by a title, a list view of Tasks and a button to add new tasks. Every task is clickable and on the click a popup appears.
This popup contains information about the task. Another popup is available when you click on the "add a card..." button, with this popup you are able to create new task  by setting the title and an optional image.

In the main we have the board, it has to be a ListView of Lists. I am struggling with it. By now it is just a layout with several List, not what i want.
